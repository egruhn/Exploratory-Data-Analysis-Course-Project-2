Question Answers
1.)  Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, 
make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
Answer for Question 1:  The total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the 
                              United States from 1999 to 2008

2.)  Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟸𝟺𝟻𝟷𝟶") from 1999 to 2008? 
Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.
Answer for Question 2:  Overall the PM 2.5 emissions have decreased from 1999
                             to 2008 in Baltimore, however there was a spike
                             in 2005 prior to the overall drop for the full
                             time period

3.)  Of the four types of sources indicated by the 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, 
which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? 
Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.
Answer for Question 3:  ON-ROAD, NON-ROAD, and NON-POINT sources have all seen
                             decreases in PM 2.5 emissions from 1999-2008.  POINT
                             sources have seen an increase over the 1999-2008
                             time period.

4.)  Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?
Answer for Question 4:  Total emissions from coal combustion-relates sources 
                             have decreased from 1999-2008, with a significant
                             drop from 2005 to 2008.

5.)  How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?
Answer for Question 5:  Total emissions from motor vehichle sources have 
                             decreased for diesel and gasoline based vehichles
                             from 1999 to 2008 in Baltimore City

6.)  Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, 
California (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟶𝟼𝟶𝟹𝟽"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
Answer for question 6:  Baltimore City has seen a negative 8% compound annual 
                             growth rate (CAGR) in emissions from motor vehicles 
                             over the 9 years of data whereas Los Angeles has 
                             experienced a positive 0.5% CAGR over the same period.
                             The data indicate that motor vehicle emissions have 
                             declined in Baltimore City and increased in Los Angeles.
